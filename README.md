# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🎮
Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This is a simple Python project where you can play the classic game against an AI opponent. The goal is to see how many rounds you can win against the AI, and the game will keep track of scores for both players.

## Features
- User-friendly interface: Choose between rock, paper, or scissors easily.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of how many rounds you and the AI have won.
- Input validation: Ensures you enter valid options during gameplay.
- Engaging user feedback: Get notified with fun emojis based on the game result (win/lose/tie).

## How to Play
1. After starting the game, you'll be asked if you want to play:

- Type yes to begin the game.
- Type no to exit the game.
- 
2. Once you start the game, you can select between:

- 1 for Rock
- 2 for Paper
- 3 for Scissors

3. The AI will also randomly choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The game will then determine the winner of the round and update the scores accordingly:

- You win 🎉 if your choice beats the AI's.
- AI wins ❌ if the AI's choice beats yours.
- It's a tie 🤝 if both choices are the same.

4. The game continues until you decide to quit by typing no when asked if you want to play again.
